## Free drawing packages

An packages provide widget that allow free draw on fixed area.

## Optimization

- Using ValueNotifier to store datas.
- Using repaint/listener to set repaint of CustomPaint. (don't need check shouldRepaint anymore).
- Avoid to split functional render on Widgets (create stateless Widget insteads).
